# Create a Token

Creating a token on Solana involves using the `spl-token` CLI.

### Step 1: Create a New Token

Run the following command to create a new token:

```bash
spl-token create-token
```

This command will output a new token address. Save this address as you will need it for subsequent steps.

### Step 2: Verify Token Creation

To verify that your token was created, you can run:

```bash
spl-token list
```
